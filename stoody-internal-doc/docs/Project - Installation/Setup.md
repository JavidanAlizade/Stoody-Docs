# Project Installation (Setup) 

## Project Folder Structure
Example of a typical monorepo structure:
```
my-monorepo/
│── apps/
│   ├── web/ (Next.js or React application)
│   ├── mobile/ (React Native application)
│── packages/
│   ├── ui/ (shared UI components)
│   ├── utils/ (utility functions)
│── .env (environment variables)
│── turbo.json (TurboRepo configuration)
│── package.json (project configuration file)
```

## Initial Project Setup

### 1. Prepare the Environment:

Ensure Required Tools Are Installed: Before starting, you need to ensure that all necessary tools and software are installed. 
- **Node.js** (for JavaScript-based projects).
- **Version control tools** like Git.
- **Text editor/IDE** (e.g., Webstorm, Sublime Text).
- **Package manager** (e.g., npm or pnpm for JavaScript).
- **Database tools** if necessary (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).

### 2. Cloning the Repository:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:Stoody-LLC/stoody-turborepo.git
cd stoody-turborepo
```
or 

###  Create a New Project:
You can create a new project either from scratch or using a starter template. 

Example, for a **Node.js** or **React** project, you would use the command:

`npx create-react-app my-project`

Alternatively, for more complex frameworks like **Next.js**, you might run:

`npx create-next-app my-next-app`

### 3. Installing Dependencies:
```sh
pnpm install
```

### 4. Configuring Environment Variables:
Create a `.env` file and add the required variables.

### 5. Running the Application:
```sh
pnpm run dev
```
or
```sh
pnpm start
```
### 6. Test the Setup:
   Ensure everything is working by checking that there are no errors during the startup and that your development server is up and running.
### 7. Set Up Linters and Formatters:
   To keep your codebase clean, install **ESLint, Prettier,** or any other code quality tools to maintain standards across the project.

### 8. Documentation:
   Create a `README.md` file to document the installation steps, how to run the project, any dependencies, and important configurations. This will help future developers or collaborators understand the setup.
