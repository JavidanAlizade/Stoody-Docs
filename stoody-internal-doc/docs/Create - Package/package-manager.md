# Package manager

**Pnpm-**  is a faster and more disk-efficient package manager because it stores packages globally and uses symlinks to share them across projects.

## Installing Packages
You can install it using the following command:

`npm install -g pnpm`

Install the project's dependencies by running:

`pnpm install`

## Adding New Packages

To add a new package to the project, use the pnpm add command:

`pnpm add <package-name>`

## Running Scripts

If there are predefined scripts in the project, you can run them using pnpm like this:

`pnpm run <script-name>`

**Example**

`pnpm run start`
